- 建立测量工具所需的步骤
(1)从文献及逻辑推论中确立构念的定义和范围(Definition and Domain of the Construct)；
(2)证明发展测量工具的必要性；
(3)发展测量的项目(Item Generation)；
(4)选择测量项目(Item Selection)；
(5)测量工具的效度检定(Construct Validation)。
- EI 构念在文献中的混乱
- Different researchers have used different definitions of EI
- Some researchers include not only emotion and intelligence, but also motivation, non-ability dispositions and traits, etc.
- For scientific construct, EI has to concentrate on “ability to handle or deal with emotions”
- EI 构念的定义和范围(1)
Appraisal and expression of emotion in the self (Self Emotional Appraisal, SEA)

       This relates to the individual’s ability to understand their deep emotions and be able to express these emotions naturally. People who have great ability in this area will sense and acknowledge their emotions well before most people.
- EI 构念的定义和范围(2)
Appraisal and recognition of emotion in others (Other’s Emotional Appraisal, OEA)
       This relates to the individual’s ability to perceive and understand the emotions of the people around them. People who are high in this ability will be much more sensitive to the feelings and emotions of others as well as reading their minds.
- EI 构念的定义和范围(3)
Regulation of emotion in the self (Regulation of Emotion, ROE)
       This relates to the ability of a person to regulate their emotions, which will enable a more rapid recovery from psychological distress. A person with great ability in this area maintains positive emotions most of the time. As a result, this dimension is sometimes referred to as “self-motivation” or the ability of a person to be self-encouraging and be positive to life stresses.
- EI 构念的定义和范围(4)
Use of emotion to facilitate performance (Use of Emotion, UOE)
       This relates to the ability of a person to make use of their emotions by directing them towards constructive activities and personal performance. A person who has high ability in this aspect is able to keep their behavior under control when they have extreme moods. The person will also make the very best use of their emotions to facilitate job performance in the workplace.
- 证明发展测量工具(EI)的必要性(1)
- 这构念在建立理论架构及增进我们知识领域的工作中是重要的:
       H1: Emotional intelligence is positively related to     job performance.
       H2: Emotional intelligence is positively related to     job satisfaction.
       H3: Emotional intelligence is positively related to     organizational commitment.
       H4: Emotional intelligence is negatively related       to turnover intention.
- 证明发展测量工具(EI)的必要性(2)
文献中没有现存适当的工具
       -- Carson, Carson and Philips (1997)        developed a 14-item measure of EI
       -- Trait Meta-Mood Scale
       -- Bar-On EQi instrument
       -- Goleman’s 10-item measure

       -- Multi-facet Emotional Intelligence Scale       (MEIS; later version: MSCEIT)
- 发展测量的项目(Item Generation)
- 定性(Qualitative)的
- Asking managers and students to generate items to capture the construct (n = 120)
- First introduced to the four dimensions of emotional intelligence
- They were then asked to generate self-reported items on each dimension that would describe a person with a high level of emotional intelligence.
- Preliminary deletion of (1) overlapping or similar items; (2) items with unclear meaning; and (3) items that did not match the definition of emotional intelligence
- Resulted in a 36-item preliminary measure of EI.
- 选择测量项目(Item Selection)
- 定量(quantitative)的
- 牵涉构念的不同构面(Dimensions)和关系网(nomological network)
- 189 undergraduate students
- Exploratory Factor Analysis (Items with high loadings): Chose 4 items for each dimension (total=16 items)
- Internal Consistency Reliability (.83 to .90)
- Correlations with IQ test, Life satisfaction, Powerlessness
- Correlations 的结果
-- The EI dimensions were all mildly correlated (ranging from r = .13 to .42), which indicated that they were related but not identical dimensions.
-- All EI dimensions correlated significantly with life satisfaction. The correlation ranged from .16 to .46.
-- All EI dimensions correlated moderately and negatively with the powerlessness measures. The correlation ranged from -.13 to -.39.
-- Finally, the EI dimensions had minimal correlations with the IQ estimate.
- Self-Report EI Items (WLEIS)

- 我很了解自己的情绪。
- 我真的能明白自己的感受。
- 我常常知道自己为甚么觉得开心或不高兴。

-- Negatively correlated with powerlessness
-- Positively correlated with life satisfaction
- 测量工具的效度检定(Construct Validation)-2

146 undergraduate student sample
-- With the specified four items loading on their respective EI dimensions, CFA: (1) c2 = 179.33 (d.f. = 98); (2) Standardized RMR = .07, CFI = .91; TLI = .89.
-- Negatively correlated with powerlessness
-- Positively correlated with life satisfaction
- 测量工具的效度检定(Construct Validation)-3

- 110 undergraduate student sample
- EFA together with Big-Five personality dimensions
- TMM (another EI measure)
- After controlling for Big-Five and TMM,
       DR2 =.077(p<.01) in predicting life satisfaction
- After controlling for Big-Five and TMM,
       DR2 =.059(p<.10) in predicting powerlessness
- 测量工具的效度检定(Construct Validation)-3

- 116 non-teaching employee sample in university
- Two measures of Big-Five dimensions and EI
- CFA (3 indicators or each Big-Five dimension and 4 for EI): c2 = 591.59 (d.f. = 398);  Standardized RMR = .08; CFI = .90; TLI = .89.
-  After controlling for Big-Five and EQ-i (another EI measure), DR2 =.023(p<.10) in predicting job satisfaction
- MTMM
- Further Evidence-1
- 149 supervisor-subordinate dyads; the 60 supervisors are middle to upper level managers
- CFA on the EI structure (209 respondents) are acceptable: c2 = 233.53 (d.f. = 98);  Standardized RMR = .05; CFI = .94; TLI = .92.
- Subordinates EI predict supervisory rated outcome variable (performance) and self-reported commitment and turnover intention. These relationships are moderated by emotional labor of the job.
- Further Evidence-2
- 145 supervisor-subordinate dyads; supervisors are Hong Kong Government middle level officers.
- Supervisor EI predicts subordinates OCB (DR2 =.015, p<.10), and job satisfaction (DR2 =.028, p<.05), after controlling for subordinate EI, job perception, education and tenure.

- 强迫选择项目的量表-1
- 发展测量的项目(1) :
- We started with 112 experienced managers.
- These managers were first introduced to the four dimensions of EI.  For each EI dimension, they were asked to write a real-life scenario and possible behavioral responses for each scenario based on their experience.  They were then asked to judge which behavioral response represents the highest level of EI.
- These scenarios and behavioral responses were examined by one of the authors.  Scenarios were deleted if (1) they were very similar to other scenarios; and/or (2) it is very easy to judge whether some of the responses are desirable or not.
- A total of 65 scenarios were chosen.

- 强迫选择项目的量表-3
- 发展测量的项目(2) :
- The human resource director of a large hotel was asked to generate ability items that would not be used in most human resource decisions.  The purpose of generating this type of ability items is to avoid the possible confusion between EI abilities and non-EI abilities that are useful in practical situation.
- The human resource manager was introduced with the four EI dimensions and the WLEIS.  She was asked to generate ability items that were similar to those embedded in the WLEIS.
- We then paired the two sets of ability items that were generated by considering similar social desirability.
- A total of 28 pairs were formed.
- Examples of Selected Items
- (a) 掌握自己高兴或不高兴原因的能力。
       (b) 学习修理一部新的家庭电器的能力。
- (a) 心算的能力。
       (b) 控制自己情绪的能力。

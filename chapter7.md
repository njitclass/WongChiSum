- 建立测量工具的步骤及证据
完整步骤及证据:(1)从文献及逻辑推论中确立构念的定义和范围；(2)证明发展测量工具的必要性；(3)发展测量的项目；(4)选择测量项目；(5)测量工具的效度检定。
有些时候可能已有一定的理论和实证研究的基础，使我们在建立新的测量工具时节省一些精力。例子：「关系」及「职业兴趣」的构念。
- 「关系」构念的定义及重要性
- guanxi refers to the connection between two parties through a system of links when one party can choose to ‘lock oneself up’ or ‘open the link’ to the other party.
- Many authors have argued that guanxi is of particular relevance in managing Chinese staff.
- 研究目标-1
- 「关系」是可以从双方面的实质行为反映(便可能透过实质行为的改变来建立)。需要以「实质行为」作这构念的测量方法。
- 有别于西方研究的「主管-部属工作交流」(Leader-Member Exchange)的纯工作关系构念，及「部属对主管的忠诚」(commitment to supervisor)的构念。
- 验证在控制了「主管-部属工作交流」和「部属对主管的忠诚」的构念后，「主管与部属关系」(Supervisor-Subordinate Guanxi)仍对主管的一些行政决定有影响。
- 研究目标-2
- 发展及选择测量项目
- We asked 49 full-time workers from government enterprises, town and village enterprises, and foreign joint venture enterprises in Tianjing, People’s Republic of China (PRC) to complete a one‑page questionnaire.

- In the questionnaire, respondents were asked to list some behaviour/activities that they would do to or for their supervisors whom they had good guanxi with.
- From these behaviour/activities, we chose six of them which are representative (i.e., mentioned by many respondents) and sufficient (i.e., clearly indicate a good supervisor-subordinate relationship)
- 样本(Sample)
- An international consumer product company and a Chinese local textile company in Hangzhou, PRC
- 13 supervisors of the consumer product company and 52 supervisors were asked to rate the job performance, job assignment, promotability, and possible allocation of bonuses to three of their immediate subordinates
- The subordinates completed a questionnaire (LMX, Guanxi, and commitment to supervisor)
- A total of 189 supervisor‑subordinate dyads were useful for further analysis.
- CFA Results
- Use CFA to test the factor structure of the 6 guanxi, 7 LMX, and 9 commitment to supervisor (identification and internalization) items
- LISREL results: c2=572.15 (d.f.=203); CFI=.85

- LISREL program modification index suggestions, most were made on correlated residuals among the LMX and commitment to supervisor items.
- After adding those correlated residuals, CFA showed quite acceptable results: c2=385.19 (d.f.=186); CFI=.92
- 「増加效度」(incremental validity)
- 以行为来测量关系构念的完整研究
详细的报告在Wong, Tinsley, Law and Mobley (2003)中 :
(1)从文献及逻辑推论中确立构念的定义和范围；
(2)证明发展测量工具的必要性；
(3)发展测量的项目；
(4)选择测量项目；
(5)测量工具的效度检定。
- 「职业兴趣」构念
荷氏模型(Holland’s Model):
(1)「实务性兴趣」(Realistic)
(2)「探究性兴趣」(Investigative)
(3)「艺术性兴趣」(Artistic)
(4)「社会性兴趣」(Social)
(5)「企业性兴趣」(Enterprising)
(6)「常规性兴趣」(Conventional)
- 荷氏模型(Holland’s Model)
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h = 关系的密切度(愈短愈密切)
- 发展 WCIAQ 的动机
Law, Wong and Leong (2001)验证了修正在香港是正确的，Wong and Wong (2001)以中学生的样本及广被接受的测量工具，也得到同一结果。因此，无论是测量工具或理论架构，「职业兴趣」的构念都是颇为确立了的。
测量工具有版权保护，要缴交版权费。香港的劳工处为了提供年青人免费的就业辅导，便希望自行发展一套具可接受信度及效度的「职业兴趣」量表。
- WCIAQ 的发展
- 16 secondary students were asked to list academic and extracurricular activities that (1) they frequently engaged and (2) they could perform better than their classmates.  These activities were then sorted into the six vocational orientations.  In the second task, selected jobs from Holland’s occupation list were presented to these students and they were asked to indicate those that they knew about.  From these two tasks, a total of 84 items were generated.
- In the second sample, 348 secondary students from one school responded to the 84 items and some criterion variables.  Using factor analysis and the relationships with the criterion variables, 72 items were selected.
- The selected items were cross-validated on the third sample of 369 secondary students from another school.  Thus, the WCIAQ consisted of 72 items with 12 items measuring each vocational orientation.
- 大学生(n=325)的样本
- Coefficient alphas .85, .86, .70, .79, .79, and .67 for RIASEC.
- CFA (3 indicators for each construct): c2=294.4 (d.f.=120), GFI=.91, CFI=.92, RMR=.015
- Discriminant validity, the correlation coefficients between the six types of vocational orientation and HKCEE are quite small, ranging from -.11 to .11
- The change in c2 from Holland’s model to the revised two-group model is statistically significant (i.e., 30.01, d.f.=4, p<.01).  Thus, the two-group model fit the data better than the Holland’s model.
- 雇员的样本(n=150)
Job Nature Measure:
- Before completing the WCIAQ and other measurement items, participants were briefed about the characteristics of job duties that can be classified as Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising or Conventional.  They were asked to evaluate their own jobs and rank the relative frequency (i.e., from 1 to 6) that they need to perform these duties in their jobs.
- The jobs were classified by comparing the mean ranking of Realistic and Investigative types of duties and the mean ranking of the other four types of job duties.  If the former was smaller, it meant that Realistic and Investigative types of job duties were more frequently performed by participants.
- 雇员样本的结果-1
- Coefficient alphas .85, .87, .80, .88, .80, and .64 for RIASEC.
- CFA (3 indicators for each construct): c2=173.5 (d.f.=120), GFI=.89, CFI=.96, RMR=.017
- Discriminant validity, the correlation coefficients between the six types of vocational orientation and education level are quite small, ranging from -.16 to .15
- The change in c2 from Holland’s model to the revised two-group model is statistically significant (i.e., 10.41, d.f.=4, p<.05).  Thus, the two-group model fit the data better than the Holland’s model.
- 雇员样本的结果-2
- WCIAQ是否适用于其他华人社会？
- 用同一方法，在香港、广州、台中及澳门四地收集了大学生样本，结果显示在四地，WCIAQ都有可接受的信度和效度的证据
- 详细的报告在Wong and Wong (2006, Journal of Career Development)中
- 小结
我们一连两章介绍了发展构念及检定其测量工具的信度和效度的例子，要再一次强调的是，这是最基础的工作，我们只有在可接受的测量工具的基础上，才可检定构念间的关系或理论模型是否正确。
由下一章开始我们会介绍在组织行为及人力资源管理的研究中，常用的设计及统计分析
